# OpenAg™ Food Computer cloud services

We use the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) to run the services we need to provide communications, databases, storage and a web user interface for the OpenAg™ Food Computers.

All of the projects in this repo assume you have your own GCP account (which you can setup for free).

If you would like to help us with any of the projects in this repo, please clone the repo and send us a documented Pull Request.   Thanks!
