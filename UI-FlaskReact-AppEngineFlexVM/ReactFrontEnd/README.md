1. Navigate to this folder (where the package.json is) and run ```npm install --save-dev```. This will create and install a bunch of node modules into the  ```node_modules/``` directory. 
2. Once this installation finishes, ```npm start ``` . React will build your project - You will see that there is a build/ folder that appears in your directory (If you are deploying to the server you can just copy the build folder and deploy it as a static site ).
